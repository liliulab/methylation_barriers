# methylation_barriers
This repository contains R code used to identify methylation barriers based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data (WGBS) or reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data.

## The batch_lmer_topo_logit.r performs statistical tests to find differentially methylated promoter-CpG island-repeat (dmPIR) trios.
